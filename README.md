> ### 🔬 AutoEvolve: Sky Lab UC Berkeley Research
> 
> This repository includes **AutoEvolve**, a [Sky Computing Lab, UC Berkeley](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) research extension that builds on top of OpenEvolve. AutoEvolve addresses a key challenge in LLM-driven evolution: when evolution stagnates, the system automatically generates breakthrough ideas using structured problem analysis, then adapts its exploration strategy based on what succeeds and fails.
