    You are an expert in cloud cost optimization. Your task is to evolve a Python strategy class to minimize the cost of completing a task under a deadline.

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  **STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE API:** You MUST only use the attributes and methods explicitly listed below. DO NOT invent or guess any other function names (e.g., `get_all_region_infos` is FORBIDDEN).
    2.  **RESPECT OBJECT LIFECYCLE:**
        - **WARNING:** In `__init__(self, args)`, you can ONLY initialize state variables (e.g., `self.my_list = []`).
        - You CANNOT access `self.env` or `self.task` in `__init__` because they are not yet available. They are initialized later by the system.
        - All logic that uses `self.env` or `self.task` MUST be within the `_step` method or other helper methods called by `_step`.
    3.  **FOCUS ON `_step`:** Your primary goal is to evolve the logic inside the `_step` method.

    ---
    **THE HIDDEN RULE: The `_apply_strong_guarantee` Override**
    ---
    **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE.** A hidden function, `_apply_strong_guarantee`, runs *after* your `_step` method and can **override** your decision. Your strategy will be much more successful if you understand and respect this rule.

    **The Rule's Logic:**
    The system calculates if the remaining task time (`remaining_task_time`) can be completed within the remaining time before the deadline (`remaining_time`).
    - `remaining_task_time` includes the actual work left AND any overheads for restarting.
    - `remaining_time` is the time left until the deadline.

    **When the Override is Triggered:**
    If `remaining_task_time >= remaining_time`, the situation is critical. The system will **FORCE** the decision to `ClusterType.ON_DEMAND` to guarantee progress, **regardless of what your `_step` method returned**.

    **How to Write a Better Strategy:**
    - **DO NOT** try to re-implement this logic.
    - **DO** internalize this rule. Your goal is to create a strategy that is smart enough to **avoid triggering the override**.
    - A good strategy senses when the deadline is approaching and proactively chooses `ON_DEMAND` *before* the strong guarantee has to take over. This gives you more control and leads to better overall costs.
    - Use the "Adaptive Urgency" hint below. It is the key to respecting this hidden rule.

    **AVAILABLE API & CONTEXT**
    ---

    **`self` (The Strategy Object):**
    - Inherits from `MultiRegionStrategy`.
    - **`self.task_duration` (float):** The total seconds of computation required for the entire task. Available only after initialization.
    - **`self.deadline` (float):** The deadline in seconds. Available only after initialization.
    - **`self.task_done_time` (list[float]):** A list tracking the seconds of work completed. Use `sum(self.task_done_time)` to get total progress.

    **`self.env` (The Environment):**
    - **`self.env.elapsed_seconds` (float):** Total time passed in the simulation.
    - **`self.env.get_num_regions() -> int`:** Returns the total number of available regions.
    - **`self.env.get_current_region() -> int`:** Returns the index of the region you are currently in.
    - **`self.env.spot_available() -> bool`:** Returns `True` if a spot instance is available in the CURRENT region.
    - **`self.env.switch_region(region_idx: int)`:** ACTION: Switches focus to a new region. The new region's state will be available in the *next* time step.

    **`self.task` (The Task Object):**
    - **`self.task.is_done` (bool):** Returns `True` if the entire task is complete.
    - **`self.task.get_info() -> dict`:** Returns a dictionary with details about the current task. For `ChainedTask`, it includes `'current_sub_task_index'`.

    **`_step(self, last_cluster_type: ClusterType, has_spot: bool)` Method:**
    - This is your main decision point, called once per time tick.
    - `has_spot` tells you the spot availability in your CURRENT region ONLY.
    - You must return a `ClusterType` (`SPOT`, `ON_DEMAND`, or `NONE`).
    - To EXPLORE: Return `ClusterType.NONE` for the current tick and call `self.env.switch_region(...)` to prepare for the next tick.

    **ADVANCED HINTS FOR EVOLUTION**
    ---
    1.  **SMARTER EXPLORATION & CACHING (Track Historical Data):** Don't just cycle regions sequentially (`+1`). A superior strategy remembers what it has learned. In `__init__`, create a dictionary like `self.region_cache = {}` to store the last known state of each region. Use this cache to make intelligent decisions about which region to explore next, avoiding regions that were recently unavailable.
    2.  **ADAPTIVE URGENCY:** Your strategy must be aware of how much time is left. Calculate a "pressure" or "urgency" metric. A simple way is to compare task progress with time elapsed: `progress = sum(self.task_done_time) / self.task_duration` vs `time_gone = self.env.elapsed_seconds / self.deadline`. If `progress < time_gone`, you are behind schedule! When pressure is high, be more aggressive with `ON_DEMAND` to guarantee progress. When pressure is low, you can afford to explore more for cheap `SPOT` instances.
    3.  **WARNING ON `task_progress`:** You might be tempted to use a variable like `self.task_progress`. This attribute does NOT exist. You MUST calculate progress manually using `sum(self.task_done_time) / self.task_duration`.
