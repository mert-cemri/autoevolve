    You are designing a single‑region scheduling strategy that must finish D hours
    of work before a deadline T. SPOT is cheap but can be evicted; On‑Demand is
    expensive but reliable. Every switch costs d hours during which no progress happens.

    ---

    ## Single‑Region API (concise)

    Implement one Python class that inherits from Strategy and defines a single
    decision method:

    ```python
    def _step(self, last_cluster_type: ClusterType, has_spot: bool) -> ClusterType:
        # return ClusterType.SPOT, ClusterType.ON_DEMAND, or ClusterType.NONE
    ```

    Available context:
    - Task
      • self.task_duration   # total work (hours or seconds)
      • self.deadline        # absolute deadline from start
      • self.task_done_time  # list of completed chunks; sum(...) is progress p(t)
      • self.restart_overhead            # d (time lost when switching)
      • self.remaining_restart_overhead  # >0 while in switch; no progress then
    - Environment
      • self.env.elapsed_seconds  # current time t
      • self.env.gap_seconds      # tick size; all comparisons should be tick‑aligned
      • self.env.tick             # tick index
      • self.env.cluster_type     # currently running type

    Return values:
      ClusterType.SPOT (cheap, may be evicted),
      ClusterType.ON_DEMAND (expensive, reliable),
      ClusterType.NONE (wait; no instance running).

    Treat tick alignment strictly (ceil/floor with gap_seconds). Equality is unsafe.

    ---

    ## UP Intuition (for contrast only; DO NOT implement UP)

    Uniform Progress (UP) sees progress on the time–progress plane and tries to
    keep enough slack so SPOT remains an option: if you drift toward the red zone,
    add just enough On‑Demand (OD) to push back and preserve future choice. This is
    only context — do NOT implement this pattern or any variant of "compare against
    a baseline/average line and nudge with OD".

    Safety (continuous time): to keep a k‑restart cushion (k∈{1,2}) at time t with
    progress p(t), you must satisfy
      T − t ≥ (D − p(t)) + k·d   ⇔   p(t) ≥ D − (T − t) + k·d
    • 1d line:  p(t) ≥ D − (T − t) + d
    • 2d line:  p(t) ≥ D − (T − t) + 2d

    Safety (tick‑aligned; preferred for code):
      left_ticks = floor((T−t)/gap)
      need0   = ceil((D−p)/gap)
      need1d  = ceil(((D−p)+d)/gap)
      need2d  = ceil(((D−p)+2d)/gap)
      od_ticks = ceil(d/gap)
    • Reaching 1d: need1d ≥ left_ticks  ⇒ must use On‑Demand to guarantee finish
    • 2d zone:     need2d ≥ left_ticks  ⇒ treat equality as unsafe (≥ triggers).

    ---

    ## Prohibited Patterns (hard constraints)
    • Do NOT implement Uniform Progress or any variant that compares to a baseline
      (e.g., ideal/average progress, B(t)=p−(D/T)·t, “catch up to a line”).
    • Do NOT use any progress-against-baseline metric to decide OD usage.
    • Decisions must be expressed only with tick‑aligned variables and observations:
      left_ticks, need1d, need2d, od_ticks, has_spot, last_cluster_type, and short‑window
      statistics derived from recent availability (e.g., α, L).

    ## Required Non‑UP Mechanisms (must include all bullets)
    • Adaptive α/L: Over a short window W ticks, compute
      - α = fraction of ticks with SPOT available;
      - L = longest uninterrupted SPOT run (in ticks) within the window.
      Use α/L to modulate thresholds (waiting budget, exit OD, sealing, cooldown, min dwell).
    • Tail sealing (endgame): Implement sealing to OD strictly earlier than the 1d line,
      e.g., seal if left_ticks ≤ need1d + m_lock(α) or when α is low and left_ticks ≤ need2d + m_lock_low.
      Optionally allow a single thaw (unlock back to SPOT) if has_spot is stable for L≥L_big and
      left_ticks > need2d + m_unlock(α). Equality is unsafe.
    • Anti‑flapping: Include a cooldown after preemption/switching and a minimum dwell time
      for OD (and optionally SPOT) before considering another switch, unless 1d triggers.

    ## Cost Awareness (bounded; optional but recommended)
    • Treat cost per tick as: c_spot = 1, c_od ≈ 3.14 (On‑Demand about 3.14× SPOT).
      This is only a tie‑breaker gate; it must never override safety or create
      a "chase‑baseline" behavior.
    • Only use cost in profitability guards for OD→SPOT decisions with a minimum dwell:
      switch OD→SPOT only if both conditions hold:
        (i) safety/dwell: require a min stable window L_dwell(α) ≥ od_ticks and
            left_ticks > need2d + m_exit(α), and
        (ii) cost: expected savings over L_dwell outweigh the restart penalty
             (use a simple threshold such as L_dwell ≥ ceil(od_ticks · κ/(κ−1)) with κ=3.14).
      Keep the math simple and tick‑aligned; do not estimate future with complex models.
    • Before any OD→SPOT attempt, make a quick gut-check that the potential segment can plausibly last longer than the deterministic breakeven H = d/(κ−1) ≈ d/2.14 (comes from equating C_spot·(L+d) = C_od·L); if it feels shorter, stay on OD so the restart overhead is not burned for nothing.

    ## Candidate Non‑UP Directions (pick at least two; keep math simple)
    1) OD Budget/Debt:
       - Initialize an OD budget in ticks (e.g., od_budget=floor(k1·need2d) with k1 depending on α).
       - Spend budget when need2d ≥ left_ticks or α is low; recover only when left_ticks > need2d + m_repair
         and SPOT runs for L≥L_min(α). When budget≤0, enter conservative mode (no long waiting).
    2) Pulse Repair (block OD injections):
       - If cushion thin (left_ticks ≤ need2d + m_pulse(α)) and !has_spot, inject a fixed OD pulse
         T_pulse ≥ od_ticks. During pulse, ignore brief SPOT flashes; stop when cushion rebuilt
         (left_ticks > need2d + m_safe(α)).
    3) Regime Switch (resource‑scarce vs resource‑rich):
       - Enter scarce regime when α≤α_low or L<od_ticks for W2 ticks; exit only after α≥α_high for W3 ticks.
       - Rich: wait‑heavy with early OD exit; Scarce: minimal waiting, aggressive sealing, higher m_exit.
    4) Debounce + Min Dwell:
       - OD min dwell: once in OD, run at least min_od_ticks(α,L) before considering exit.
       - SPOT debounce: require has_spot consecutive ≥ M(α) and left_ticks > need2d + m_exit(α) to leave OD.
    5) Chance‑Constrained Risk Line (simplified):
       - Define need_risk = ceil(((D−p)+d+h(α,L)·d)/gap) with h∈[1.0,2.0] (larger when α/L low).
         Treat need_risk ≥ left_ticks as a risk zone with stricter actions than 2d.
    6) Idle Quota:
       - Maintain a rolling idle_quota=q(α) over window W; NONE ticks consume it.
         When quota depleted, disallow waiting until cushion rebuilt or a pulse completes.

    ## Acceptance
    • Tick‑aligned comparisons only; equality is unsafe.
    • Clearly state conditions for: wait→OD, OD→SPOT/NONE, sealing/thaw, cooldowns, dwell times.
    • Keep parameters few and readable; tie them to α/L with simple step functions.
