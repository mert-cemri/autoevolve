The divisors can be calculated using the formula for the number of divisors:\n\\[\n(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\nThe divisors are obtained by taking all combinations of the prime factors:\n- \\(2^0 \\times 71^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 71^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 71^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 71^1 = 71\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 71^1 = 142\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 71^1 = 284\\)\n\nThus, the divisors of 284 are \\(1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284\\). The proper divisors (excluding 284) are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284\n\nNow, we sum the proper divisors:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the proper divisors of 220\n\nNext, we find the proper divisors of 220. We start with its prime factorization.\n\n- 220 is even, so we divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  220 \\div 2 = 110\n  \\]\n- 110 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n  \\[\n  110 \\div 2 = 55\n  \\]\n- 55 can be factored as \\(5 \\times 11\\).\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 220 is:\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\n\\]\n\nNow, we find all the divisors of 220:\n- The number of divisors is given by:\n\\[\n(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nThe divisors are:\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0 = 5\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0 = 10\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1 = 11\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1 = 22\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1 = 44\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 = 55\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 = 110\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 = 220\\)\n\nThe proper divisors of 220 (excluding 220) are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 220\n\nNow, we sum the proper divisors:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\\[\n1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + 4 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n7 + 5 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n12 + 10 = 22\n\\]\n\\[\n22 + 11 = 33\n\\]\n\\[\n33 + 20 = 53\n\\]\n\\[\n53 + 22 = 75\n\\]\n\\[\n75 + 44 = 119\n\\]\n\\[\n119 + 55 = 174\n\\]\n\\[\n174 + 110 = 284\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is \\(284\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{284}\n\\]\n\n### SUMMARY\nThe sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is \\(284\\).",
