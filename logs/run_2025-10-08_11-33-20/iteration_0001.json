What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\nSolution to refine:\nTo solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of the sum obtained in step 2.**\n4. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors found in step 3.**\n\nLet's go through these steps one by one.\n\n### Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284\n\nFirst, we need to find the divisors of 284. We start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n- 284 is even, so we divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  284 \\div 2 = 142\n  \\]\n- 142 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n  \\[\n  142 \\div 2 = 71\n  \\]\n- 71 is a prime number.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 284 is:\n\\[\n284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the divisors of 284 using its prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\) is \\((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\). Here, we have:\n\\[\n(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\nThis means there are 6 divisors. The divisors can be calculated as follows:\n- \\(1\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 71^0\\))\n- \\(2\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 71^0\\))\n- \\(4\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 71^0\\))\n- \\(71\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 71^1\\))\n- \\(142\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 71^1\\))\n- \\(284\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 71^1\\))\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284\n\nNow we sum the proper divisors:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the proper divisors of 220\n\nNext, we need to find the proper divisors of 220. We start with its prime factorization.\n\n- 220 is even, so we divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  220 \\div 2 = 110\n  \\]\n- 110 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n  \\[\n  110 \\div 2 = 55\n  \\]\n- 55 can be factored as \\(5 \\times 11\\), both of which are prime.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 220 is:\n\\[\n220 = 2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the divisors of 220:\n- The number of divisors is given by:\n\\[\n(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nThe divisors can be calculated as follows:\n- \\(1\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(2\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(4\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(5\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(10\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(11\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1\\))\n- \\(20\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^0\\))\n- \\(22\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1\\))\n- \\(44\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 5^0 \\times 11^1\\))\n- \\(55\\) (from \\(2^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\))\n- \\(110\\) (from \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\))\n- \\(220\\) (from \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\))\n\nThe proper divisors of 220 are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 220\n\nNow we sum the proper divisors:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n- \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n- \\(7 + 5 = 12\\)\n- \\(12 + 10 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 11 = 33\\)\n- \\(33 + 20 = 53\\)\n- \\(53 + 22 = 75\\)\n- \\(75 + 44 = 119\\)\n- \\(119 + 55 = 174\\)\n- \\(174 + 110 = 284\\)\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is:\n\\[\n284\n\\]\n\nFinally, we conclude with the final answer:\nFINAL ANSWER: \\boxed{284}\nCONFIDENCE: 1.0",

For \\(d = 13\\) to hold, both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) must be divisible by \\(13\\).\n\n5. First, we check the condition for \\(n + 7\\):\n   \\[\n   n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv -7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n   \\]\n\n6. Next, we check the condition for \\(2n + 1\\):\n   \\[\n   2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies 2n \\equiv -1 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n   \\]\n\n7. Since both conditions yield \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\), we can conclude that there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) are divisible by \\(13\\).\n\n8. Therefore, the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is \\(13\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nFINAL ANSWER: \\boxed{13}\nCONFIDENCE: 1.0",

          "response": "To find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\), we will use properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).\n\n1. Let \\(d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\). By the properties of gcd, \\(d\\) divides any linear combination of \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\).\n\n2. We express \\(2n + 1\\) in terms of \\(n + 7\\):\n   \\[\n   2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 14 + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13.\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   d \\mid (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = -13.\n   \\]\n\n3. This implies that \\(d\\) must divide \\(13\\). The divisors of \\(13\\) are \\(1\\) and \\(13\\).\n\n4. To check if \\(d = 13\\) is possible, both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) must be divisible by \\(13\\).\n\n5. For \\(n + 7\\):\n   \\[\n   n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv -7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n   \\]\n\n6. For \\(2n + 1\\):\n   \\[\n   2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies 2n \\equiv -1 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n   \\]\n\n7. Both conditions yield \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\), confirming that there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) are divisible by \\(13\\).\n\nThus, the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is \\(13\\).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \\boxed{13}  \nCONFIDENCE: 1.0"
