Substitute \\( b \\) into (7) and (8) similarly to find consistent values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nFinally, we compute \\( P(5) \\):\n\\[\nP(5) = 125 + 25a + 5b + 5.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( b \\) from (5) into this expression will yield \\( P(5) \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nAfter solving, we find:\n\\[\nP(5) = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\]",

          "user_message": "Problem:\nLet $n$ be a positive integer.  What is the greatest possible value of $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$?\n\nVerified Solution:\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\), we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd). We denote \\(d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\).\n\nUsing the property that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - ka)\\) for any integer \\(k\\), we can simplify our gcd calculation. We will set \\(a = n + 7\\) and \\(b = 2n + 1\\).\n\nWe can compute:\n\\[\n2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = 1 - 14 = -13.\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nd = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, -13).\n\\]\nSince the gcd is always non-negative, we can write:\n\\[\nd = \\gcd(n + 7, 13).\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the possible values of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\). The number 13 is prime, so the possible values of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\) can be either 1 or 13, depending on whether \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13.\n\nTo find when \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13, we set up the congruence:\n\\[\nn + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn \\equiv -7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(n\\) can be expressed in the form:\n\\[\nn = 13k + 6 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(n\\) is of this form, then:\n\\[\nn + 7 = 13k + 6 + 7 = 13k + 13 = 13(k + 1),\n\\]\nwhich is clearly divisible by 13. Therefore, in this case, \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 13\\).\n\nIf \\(n + 7\\) is not divisible by 13, then \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 1\\).\n\nThus, the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}.\n\\]\n\nSELF_CHECK: The calculations confirm that \\(n + 7\\) can be made divisible by 13, yielding the maximum gcd of 13.",
