Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\) are either 1 or 13, depending on whether \\( n + 7 \\) is divisible by 13.\n\nTo find when \\( n + 7 \\) is divisible by 13, we set up the congruence:\n\\[\nn + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nn \\equiv -7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nn = 13k + 6 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n\\]\n\nIf \\( n + 7 \\) is of the form \\( 13m \\) for some integer \\( m \\), then \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 13 \\).\n\nTo check if this is achievable, we can substitute \\( n = 6 \\) (the smallest positive integer satisfying \\( n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13} \\)):\n\\[\nn + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 2(6) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\gcd(13, 13) = 13.\n\\]\n\nSince we have shown that \\( d \\) can indeed equal 13, we conclude that the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}.\n\\]",
