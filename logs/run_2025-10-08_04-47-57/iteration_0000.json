We start by determining its prime factorization.\n\n- 284 is even, so we divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  284 \\div 2 = 142\n  \\]\n- 142 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n  \\[\n  142 \\div 2 = 71\n  \\]\n- 71 is a prime number.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 284 is:\n\\[\n284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n\\]\n\nNext, we find all the divisors of 284 using its prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\) is \\((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\). Here, we have:\n\\[\n(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\nThis means there are 6 divisors. We can list them by taking combinations of the prime factors:\n- \\( 2^0 \\times 71^0 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^1 \\times 71^0 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 \\times 71^0 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2^0 \\times 71^1 = 71 \\)\n- \\( 2^1 \\times 71^1 = 142 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 \\times 71^1 = 284 \\)\n\nThus, the divisors of 284 are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284\n\\]\n\nThe proper divisors (which are less than 284) are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284\n\nNow we sum the proper divisors:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\\[\n1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + 4 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n7 + 71 = 78\n\\]\n\\[\n78 + 142 = 220\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is:\n\\[\n220\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the proper divisors of 220\n\nNext, we find the proper divisors of 220.

Specifically, we can apply the Euclidean algorithm, which states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\).\n\nLet \\(a = n + 7\\) and \\(b = 2n + 1\\). We will compute \\(b \\mod a\\):\n\n\\[\nb - 2a = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = 1 - 14 = -13\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, -13) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13)\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the possible values of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\). Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\) can either be 1 or 13, depending on whether \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13.\n\nTo find when \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13, we set up the congruence:\n\n\\[\nn + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod{13}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv -7 \\mod{13}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(-7\\) is equivalent to \\(6\\) modulo \\(13\\) (because \\(-7 + 13 = 6\\)), we have:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 6 \\mod{13}\n\\]\n\nThis means that \\(n\\) can be expressed in the form:\n\n\\[\nn = 13k + 6\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\(k\\). Substituting this back into \\(n + 7\\):\n\n\\[\nn + 7 = (13k + 6) + 7 = 13k + 13 = 13(k + 1)\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13, which means:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",
