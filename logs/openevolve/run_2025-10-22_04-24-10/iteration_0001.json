Suppose that $P(x)$ has remainder $R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4),$ and remainder $2R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3).$  Given that $P(0) = 5,$ find $P(5).$\n\nSolution to Refine:\nRevised solution:\n\nLet P be monic of degree 3 with P(0) = 5. Write\n- P(x) = x^3 + m x^2 + n x + 5\n- Remainder when dividing by (x\u22121)(x\u22124) is R(x) = ax + b, so remainder when dividing by (x\u22122)(x\u22123) is 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b.\n\nBy the division algorithm,\n- P(1) = R(1) = a + b\n- P(4) = R(4) = 4a + b\n- P(2) = 2R(2) = 4a + 2b\n- P(3) = 2R(3) = 6a + 2b\n\nExpress P at these points in terms of m, n:\n- P(1) = 1 + m + n + 5 = m + n + 6\n- P(2) = 8 + 4m + 2n + 5 = 13 + 4m + 2n\n- P(3) = 27 + 9m + 3n + 5 = 32 + 9m + 3n\n- P(4) = 64 + 16m + 4n + 5 = 69 + 16m + 4n\n\nStep to relate a, b, m, n:\n- From P(3) \u2212 P(2): 2a = (32 + 9m + 3n) \u2212 (13 + 4m + 2n) = 19 + 5m + n\n  Hence a = (19 + 5m + n)/2.\n- From P(4) \u2212 P(2): \u2212b = (69 + 16m + 4n) \u2212 (13 + 4m + 2n) = 56 + 12m + 2n\n  Hence b = \u221256 \u2212 12m \u2212 2n.\n- Now P(1) = a + b gives the equation\n  a + b = m + n + 6\n  Substituting a and b:\n  (19 + 5m + n)/2 + (\u221256 \u2212 12m \u2212 2n) = m + n + 6\n  Multiply by 2 and simplify:\n  19 + 5m + n \u2212 112 \u2212 24m \u2212 4n = 2m + 2n + 12\n  \u221293 \u2212 19m \u2212 3n = 2m + 2n + 12\n  \u2212105 \u2212 21m \u2212 5n = 0\n  Therefore the correct equation is\n  21m + 5n = \u2212105.    (E1)\n\nAlso, using P(3) = 6a + 2b and the expressions for a, b,\n  6a + 2b = P(3) \u21d2 6a + 2b = 32 + 9m + 3n\n  Substituting a and b gives\n  -55 \u2212 9m \u2212 n = 32 + 9m + 3n\n  which simplifies to\n  18m + 4n = \u221287.

          "response": "Refined reasoning:\nLet d = gcd(n+7, 2n+1). Then d divides (2n+1) \u2212 2(n+7) = \u221213, so d | 13. Thus gcd(n+7, 2n+1) \u2208 {1, 13}. The value 13 occurs exactly when 13 | (n+7), i.e., n \u2261 6 (mod 13). In that case 2n+1 \u2261 2\u00b76+1 \u2261 0 (mod 13) as well, so gcd = 13.
