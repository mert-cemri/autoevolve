Then\nP(1) = R(1) = m + n, and P(4) = R(4) = 4m + n.\n\nSince dividing by (x \u2212 2)(x \u2212 3) gives remainder 2R(x),\nP(2) = 2R(2) = 4m + 2n, and P(3) = 2R(3) = 6m + 2n.\n\nCompute P(k) in terms of a,b,c (with c = 5):\n- P(1) = 1 + a + b + c = a + b + 6\n- P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + c = 4a + 2b + 13\n- P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + c = 9a + 3b + 32\n- P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + c = 16a + 4b + 69\n\nFrom P(1) = m + n and P(2) = 4m + 2n, solve for m,n in terms of a,b:\nLet S = m + n = a + b + 6 and T = 4m + 2n = 4a + 2b + 13.\nSolving gives m = a + 1/2 and n = b + 11/2.\n\nUse P(4) and P(3):\nP(4) = 16a + 4b + 69 = 4m + n = 4(a + 1/2) + (b + 11/2) = 4a + b + 15/2,\nwhich yields 8a + 2b = -41.\n\nP(3) = 9a + 3b + 32 = 6m + 2n = 6(a + 1/2) + 2(b + 11/2) = 6a + 2b + 14,\nwhich yields 3a + b = -18, i.e. b = -3a - 18.\n\nSubstitute into 8a + 2b = -41:\n8a + 2(-3a - 18) = -41\n=> 8a - 6a - 36 = -41\n=> 2a = -5\n=> a = -5/2, and b = -3(-5/2) - 18 = 15/2 - 18 = -21/2.\n\nThus P(x) = x^3 - (5/2)x^2 - (21/2)x + 5.\n\nCompute P(5):\nP(5) = 125 + 25a + 5b + c\n= 125 + 25(-5/2) + 5(-21/2) + 5\n= 125 - 125/2 - 105/2 + 5\n= 125 - 115 + 5\n= 15.\n\nBoxed final result:\n\\boxed{15}\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \\boxed{15}",
