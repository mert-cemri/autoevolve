What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\nProposed Solution:\nLet s(n) be the sum of the proper divisors of n.\n\n- Factor 284: 284 = 2^2 \u00b7 71. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142. So s(284) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\n- Factor 220: 220 = 2^2 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 11. The sum of all divisors is\n  sigma(220) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5)(1 + 11) = 7 \u00b7 6 \u00b7 12 = 504.\n  Hence s(220) = sigma(220) \u2212 220 = 504 \u2212 220 = 284.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.\n\n\\boxed{284}\n",
          "response": "VERIFICATION: s(284) = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220. Then sigma(220) = (1+2+4)(1+5)(1+11) = 7*6*12 = 504, so s(220) = 504 \u2212 220 = 284. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284. The arithmetic is correct.\nERRORS: None\nDECISION: APPROVED\nCONFIDENCE: 0.93",
