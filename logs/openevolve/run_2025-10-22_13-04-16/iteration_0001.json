These are valid recursive definitions of addition.\n- Step 3: Computes 2 + 2 by recognizing 2 as S(1), so 2 + 2 = 2 + S(1). By the rule n + S(m) = S(n + m), this becomes S(2 + 1). Correct.\n- Step 4: Computes 2 + 1: since 1 = S(0), 2 + 1 = 2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2). And 2 + 0 = 2, so this equals S(2) = 3. This is correct.\n- Step 5: Substitutes back: 2 + 2 = S(2 + 1) = S(3).

These are the correct recursive definitions used to build addition.\n- Step 3: Derives 2 + 2 as 2 + S(1) using 2 = S(1), then applies n + S(m) = S(n + m) to obtain S(2 + 1). This is a valid application of the recursive rule, since 2 = S(1) and you are adding S(1) to 2.\n- Step 4: Computes 2 + 1 by the same rules: 2 + 1 = 2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2) = 3. This is correct because 2 + 0 = 2, and S(2) is 3.\n- Step 5: Substitutes the result from Step 4 into Step 3: 2 + 2 = S(3). Since 3 = S(2) and S(3) = 4, the final result is 4.
