This step is correct since any gcd must divide any integer combination of the two numbers.\n- To achieve d = 13, both n+7 and 2n+1 must be divisible by 13. This leads to the congruences n \u2261 -7 \u2261 6 (mod 13) and 2n \u2261 -1 \u2261 12 (mod 13). Since 2 has inverse 7 modulo 13, multiplying 12 by 7 gives n \u2261 6 (mod 13), which is consistent with the first congruence.
