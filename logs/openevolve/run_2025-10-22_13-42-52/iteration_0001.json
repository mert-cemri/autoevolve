          "response": "VERIFICATION:\n1. Correctly notes that gcd(n+7, 2n+1) divides any linear combination; computes (2n+1) \u2212 2(n+7) = \u221213, hence gcd | 13. Therefore gcd \u2208 {1, 13}. \n2. Correctly shows that if n \u2261 6 (mod 13), then n+7 \u2261 0 and 2n+1 \u2261 0 (mod 13), so gcd is at least 13; since gcd divides 13, it must be 13. Example n = 6 confirms gcd(13, 13) = 13.\n3. Concludes the greatest possible value is 13. All steps are logically sound and arithmetically correct.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\nISSUES: None\nCONFIDENCE: 0.92",
