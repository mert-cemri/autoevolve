The smallest distance is for 12th grade.\n- Therefore, the 12th grade is the closest.\n\nFinal answer matches the proposed conclusion.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\n\nISSUES: The proposed solution contains a notational slip: it writes M = 3 pm and F = 3 pf, whereas the correct expressions are M = 300 pm and F = 300 pf. This does not affect the final result since the 300 factors cancel in the ratio, but it should be corrected for clarity.\n\nCONFIDENCE: 0.79",
