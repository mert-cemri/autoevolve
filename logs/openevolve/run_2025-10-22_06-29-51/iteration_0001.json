For example, n = 6 yields gcd(13, 13) = 13.\n\n\\boxed{13}",
          "response": "VERIFICATION: The gcd identity holds: gcd(n+7, 2n+1) = gcd(n+7, (2n+1) - 2(n+7)) = gcd(n+7, -13) = gcd(n+7, 13). Therefore the gcd divides 13, so the maximum possible value is 13. It is achieved when n+7 is a multiple of 13, e.g., n = 6 yields gcd(13, 13) = 13.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\n\nISSUES: NONE\n\nCONFIDENCE: 0.92",
