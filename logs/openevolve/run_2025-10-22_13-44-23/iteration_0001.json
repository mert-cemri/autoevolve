          "user_message": "Problem:\nLet $n$ be a positive integer.  What is the greatest possible value of $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$?\n\nSolution to refine:\nStep-by-step:\n- Let d = gcd(n+7, 2n+1). Since d divides any integer combination of these two numbers, in particular\n  2(n+7) \u2212 (2n+1) = 13,\n  we have d | 13. Therefore d \u2208 {1, 13}.\n- To achieve d = 13, we need 13 | (n+7) and 13 | (2n+1). If 13 | (n+7), then n \u2261 \u22127 \u2261 6 (mod 13). Check: 2n+1 \u2261 2\u00b76+1 \u2261 13 \u2261 0 (mod 13). So such n exist (e.g., n = 6 gives gcd(13, 13) = 13).\n- Hence the greatest possible value is 13.\n\nSUMMARY: The greatest possible value is 13.\n\n\\boxed{13}",
