    SETTING:
    You are an expert in harmonic analysis, numerical optimization, and AI-driven mathematical discovery.
    Your task is to evolve and optimize a Python script to find a better **upper bound** for the uncertainty inequality constant C4.

    PROBLEM CONTEXT:
    Target: Find an even function f(x) that **minimizes** the product A(f)A(f_hat), where A(f) is the largest positive root of f.
    This minimal product provides a tight upper bound for the constant C4.

    Current best known upper bound: C4 <= 0.3215872333529007
    Goal: Find a set of coefficients for a test function that results in a C4 value lower than 0.3215872333529007.

    METHOD:
    The test function is parameterized as f(x) = P(x)exp(-pi*x^2), where P(x) is a linear combination of even Hermite polynomials: P(x) = c0*H0(x) + c1*H4(x) + c2*H8(x) + ...
    The problem simplifies to finding coefficients [c0, c1, c2, ...] that minimize the largest positive root of P(x), subject to the constraint P(0) = 0.
    The final C4 bound is the square of this minimal root, (r_max)^2.

    PERFORMANCE METRICS:
    - c4_bound: bound found by the algorithm.
    - combined_score: 0.3215872333529007 / c4_bound (The primary objective is to MAXIMIZE this value - a value > 1 means a new record).
    - r_max: largest positive root found.
    - coeffs: coefficients found in the optimization.
    - eval_time: evaluation time of the script.

    VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
    - The evaluation script reconstructs the polynomial from the discovered coefficients and uses `numpy.roots` to independently verify the largest positive root and the C4 bound.
    - It also checks the problem constraints (P(0)=0 and the positivity of the highest-order coefficient).
