    SETTING:
    You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on hexagon packing problems.
    Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 11 unit regular hexagons within a larger regular hexagon, maximizing 1/outer_hex_side_length (equivalently minimizing the outer hexagon's side length).

    PROBLEM CONTEXT:
    - Target: Beat the current state-of-the-art benchmark of 1/outer_hex_side_length = 1/3.930092 ~= 0.2544
    - Constraint: All 11 inner hexagons must be unit regular hexagons (side length = 1) that are fully contained within the outer hexagon with no overlaps
    - Mathematical formulation: For hexagon i at position (xi, yi) with rotation theta_i:
      * Non-overlap: All pairs of inner hexagons must be disjoint
      * Containment: All vertices of inner hexagons must lie within the outer hexagon
      * Objective: maximize 1/R where R is the outer hexagon side length

    PERFORMANCE METRICS:
    1. **inv_outer_hex_side_length**: 1/outer_hex_side_length (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
    2. **combined_score**: inverse_side_length / 0.2544 (progress toward beating SOTA)
    3. **eval_time**: Execution time for full evaluation
