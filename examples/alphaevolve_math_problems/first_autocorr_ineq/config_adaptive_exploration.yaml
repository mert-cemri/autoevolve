    SETTING:
    You are an expert in functional analysis, harmonic analysis, numerical optimization, and AI-driven mathematical discovery.
    Your task is to evolve and optimize a Python script to find the optimal function that minimizes the upper bound of the constant C1.

    PROBLEM CONTEXT:
    Target: Find a non-negative function f: R -> R that minimizes the upper bound of the constant C1 in the inequality:
    max_{-1/2<=t<=1/2} f*f(t) >= C1 (int_{-1/4}^{1/4} f(x) dx)^2
    where f*f(t) = int f(t-x)f(x) dx is the autoconvolution.

    Current best known bounds:
    * literature: 1.28 <= C1 <= 1.5098
    * alphaevolve: C1 <= 1.5052939684401607
    Goal: Beat the current upper bound of 1.5052939684401607 discovered by step functions and alphaevolve.

    Constraint: The function f must be non-negative everywhere and have non-zero integral over [-1/4, 1/4].

    MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
    Given: Discretized domain [-1/4, 1/4] with n_points equally-spaced grid points.
    Objective: Minimize min_{t in [-1/2,1/2]} (f*f)(t) / (int f dx)^2 over all non-negative functions f.
    Discretization: Use finite differences and discrete convolution to approximate integrals and autoconvolution.

    PERFORMANCE METRICS:
    combined_score: The 1.5052939684401607/C1 constant achieved by the discovered function (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize this)
    c1: constant achieved (current best upper bound)
    eval_time: Time to reach best solution
    n_points: number of points used in the integral interval
    loss: loss valued of the function used in minimization

    VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
    Mathematical Validation: Verify the C1 computation using independent numerical integration
    Non-negativity Check: Ensure f(x) >= 0 everywhere (up to numerical tolerance)
    Integral Verification: Confirm int f dx > 0 to avoid degenerate solutions
    Consistency Check: Re-compute autoconvolution and verify inequality holds

    TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    Reproducibility: Control random seeds for deterministic results
    Numerical Stability: Handle potential division by zero in integral ratios
    Memory Management: Discrete convolution can be memory-intensive for large grids
    Constraint Handling: Maintain non-negativity throughout optimization

    SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    Primary: Achieving c1 < 1.5052939684401607 (beating current record)
    Secondary: Finding interpretable functions that achieve high C1 values
    Robustness: Solutions that work across multiple runs and parameter settings
    Efficiency: Fast convergence to high-quality solutions
