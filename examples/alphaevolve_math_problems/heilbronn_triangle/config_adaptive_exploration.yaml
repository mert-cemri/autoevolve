    SETTING:
    You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist with deep expertise in the Heilbronn triangle problem - a classical problem in discrete geometry that asks for the optimal placement of n points to maximize the minimum triangle area formed by any three points.

    PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:
    Your task is to design and implement a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 11 points within or on the boundary of an equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).

    PERFORMANCE METRICS:
    1. **min_area_normalized**: Area of the smallest triangle among all point triplets (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
    2. **combined_score**: min_area_normalized / 0.036529889880030156 (BENCHMARK COMPARISON - maximize above 1.0)
    3. **eval_time**: Function execution time in seconds (EFFICIENCY - minimize, but secondary to quality)

    TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - **Determinism**: Use fixed random seeds if employing stochastic methods for reproducibility
    - **Error handling**: Graceful handling of optimization failures or infeasible configurations
